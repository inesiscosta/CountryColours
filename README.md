# CountryColours
A Website for a Painting Business called Country Colours - Computer Science (High-Level) Internal Assessment as part of the International Baccalaureate Diploma

Made using Node.js connected to a database in phpmyAdmin any "Secrets" as in have obviously been changed for security purposes but kept in for illustrative purposes.
This project won't run as is, node and the appropriate packages/modules should be installed.
A list can be found in package.json it just made no sense for me to upload the whole node-modules folder.
For convinience however, here is a list of the packages used:
bcrypt
body-parser
connect-flash
cookie-parser
dotenv
ejs
express
express-flash
express-session
jsonwebtoken
mysql2
nodemailer
passport
passport-local
vanilla-tilt

For dev purposes nodemon was also used.
